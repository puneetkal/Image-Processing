The figure given below is an x-ray of the shotgun wound of the wrist of a soldier, showing the 
shrapnels trapped inside. Surgery is necessary for the removal of the shrapnels, for which a total count of 
the same is extremely important. Write a python code that reads the x-ray image and calculates the total 
number shrapnels, which need to be removed. Assume the soldier has suffered high blood loss due to 
injuries and the operation has to be performed in a very short time, write a code to prepare a work plan for 
the surgery team, which highlights the shrapnels in red, green and yellow colors, depending on the density 
of their distribution (in the decreasing order)
